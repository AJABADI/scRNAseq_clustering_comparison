# DBscan
#####################
# dbscan is a density based clustering method. The k neirest neighborhoud parameter and neighborhood size (epsilon) has to be defined.
# This is usually done using a k neirest neighbour distance plot. for this strategy the k-nearest neighbor distance is plotted (k-NN distance)
# this is the distance from a choosen point to its k nearest neighbors. As a rule of thumb k >= d+1, here d is the dimension of the data.
# A sharp change in the distance plot indicates the epsilon distance. 
# If only one single cluster is obtained, then often epsilon is too large or MinPts is too small.
# similary, if epsilon is too small or MinPts is too large then every point becomes a noise point.
# note that dbscan has problems with high dim data , so we should reduce the dimension, which is done using PCA and working on latent space with 50 dim.
