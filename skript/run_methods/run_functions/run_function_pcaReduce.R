# pcaReduce uses a PCA and hierarchical clustering to find the number of clusters in the reduced dimension given by PCA. 
# The method expects that large classes of cells ar contained in low dimension PC representation
# and more refined (subsets) of these cells types are contained in higher dimensional PC representations.
# On the latent space (nxq) a kmeans clustering with q+1 clusters is performed. And the PC with the lowest variance is deleted. this process is iteratively repeated until only one single cluster remains.
# The resulting matrix has dimension nxq with q+1 clusters.
# Parameters to define are the number of times the method should be repeated, as pcaReduce is stochastic. Sampling without replacement; we choose nbt = 100, if the number samples is bigger than 100.
# The number of starting principal components q, we choose 50 as the default.
# And the number clusters n which is given by the "ground truth". the stepwise merging of the clusters can be done using sampling based merging (S) or
# merging based on largest probability (M).
